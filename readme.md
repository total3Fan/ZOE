Application
================================================================

ZOE: Is an open source project that enables you to take Tradingview Alerts using any indicator, have data pass to a webhook then trades place on binancefutures listings.

Objective of placing this source onto GitHub is to encourage others to offer multiple source code variations such as Python and others. Also additional exchanges to binancefutures which it currently offers.

ZOE will take the tradingview alerts, then place them within a database table named 'tradingview_alerts' and have 3 cron jobs to carry out the following processes:

1. Scan for trades within tradingview_alerts
2. Place trades onto orderbook within binancefutures with both TargetPoints and StopLoss
3. Scan current trades to see if % profit has been achieved to move the StopLoss up to secure profits.
4. Scan order book for any dead trades sitting and clear them automatically.
5. Scan trades and if a LONG is currently in play and a SHORT is given, ZOE will automatically remove the long and place the SHORT.

Tradingview Indicator
================================================================

ZOE has her own indicator if desired: Details can be found on the link below

https://www.tradingview.com/script/5mhMn5Di-Zoe/ 

If you want to use your own Indicator the following information is requred to be sent to ZOE tradingview alerts:

LONG,BTCUSDT.P,42822,240,43953,46536,41370
SHORT,BTCUSDT.P,42822,240,43953,46536,41370

Indicator for ZOE uses the following format:

LONG,{{ticker}},{{close}},{{interval}},{{plot_5}},{{plot_9}},{{plot_2}}
SHORT,{{ticker}},{{close}},{{interval}},{{plot_5}},{{plot_9}},{{plot_2}}
